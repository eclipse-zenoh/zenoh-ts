# Eclipse Zenoh Typescript / Javascript API

The Eclipse Zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query, and Compute.

Zenoh (pronounced _/zeno/_) unifies data in motion, data at rest, and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with
geo-distributed storage, queries, and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any
of the mainstream stacks.

Check the website [zenoh.io](http://zenoh.io) and the [roadmap](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap) for more detailed information.

## Typescript/Javascript API

This repository provides a Typescript / Javascript binding through the use of the `zenoh-plugin-remote-api` in this repo.
The long-term plan is to use zenoh [Zenoh written in Rust](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh) to target WASM.
In its current state, it is not possible to compile Zenoh (Rust) to target WASM, and it will need to undergo a fair
amount of refactoring before that can happen.

The latest version of the zenoh-ts library can be installed from npm:

```sh
npm install @eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-ts
```

Docs can be accessed at [Docs Link](https://eclipse-zenoh.github.io/zenoh-ts/)

The library requires a websocket connection to the `zenohd` daemon through the `zenohd-plugin-remote-api` in the daemon. See the corresponding section below.

## How to build and use zenoh-ts

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning: : Zenoh and its ecosystem are under active development. When you build from git, make sure you also
build from git any other Zenoh repository you plan to use (e.g. binding, plugin, backend, etc.). It may happen that some changes in git
are not compatible with the most recent packaged Zenoh release (e.g. deb, docker, pip). We put particular effort into maintaining
compatibility between the various git repositories in the Zenoh project.

### Executing the `zenohd` with `zenoh-plugin-remote-api` plugin

The `zenohd` router and its plugins should be built with the same Zenoh sources, the same version of the Rust compiler, and with the
same set of features. This requirement exists because the router and plugins share common Rust structures, and Rust doesn't guarantee
ABI compatibility of the memory representation of these structures.

Therefore, one of the methods below is recommended to ensure that the plugin and router are compatible.

The file `EXAMPLE_CONFIG.json5` references the `zenoh-plugin-remote-api\EXAMPLE_CONFIG.json5` with the minimal necessary set of options to run the plugin. See also the full set of available options, like SSL certificate settings in `zenoh-plugin-remote-api\config.json5`.

1. Install the latest release of `zenohd` and `zenoh-plugin-remote-api`

   Ubuntu:

   ```sh
   echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://download.eclipse.org/zenoh/debian-repo/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zenoh.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install zenohd
   sudo apt install zenoh-plugin-remote-api
   ```

   Mac-OS:

   ```sh
   brew tap eclipse-zenoh/homebrew-zenoh
   brew install zenoh
   brew install zenoh-plugin-remote-api
   ```

   Run the installed zenoh router with the example config

   ```sh
   zenohd --config EXAMPLE_CONFIG.json5
   ```
  
   The expected output should be something similar to:

    ```txt
   zenohd: zenohd v1.0.3 built with rustc 1.75.0 (82e1608df 2023-12-21)
   zenoh::net::runtime: Using ZID: f7bc54e0941036422ec08ebac6fbdb40
   zenoh::api::loader: Loading  plugin "remote_api"
   zenoh::api::loader: Starting  plugin "remote_api"
   zenoh::api::loader: Successfully started plugin remote_api from "/usr/lib/libzenoh_plugin_remote_api.so"
   zenoh::api::loader: Finished loading plugins
   zenoh::net::runtime::orchestrator: Zenoh can be reached at: tcp/....
   ```

2. Build both the plugin and the router from the sources:

   Build the plugin `zenoh-plugin-remote-api`

   ```sh
   cargo build 
   ```

   Build and run `zenohd` from the same sources used for the plugin. The `zenohd` dependency is specified in the `[workspace.metadata.bin]` section in `Cargo.toml`, which is processed by the third-party tool [cargo-run-bin](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-run-bin).

   The `zenohd` binary is built into the `.bin` directory local to the project. If necessary, remove the `.bin` directory with `rm -rf .bin` to rebuild it, as the `cargo-run-bin` tool does not handle this automatically.

   ```sh
   cargo install cargo-run-bin
   cargo bin zenohd --config EXAMPLE_CONFIG.json5
   ```  

   The expected output should be something similar to:

   ```txt
   zenohd: zenohd vc764bf9b built with rustc 1.75.0 (82e1608df 2023-12-21)
   zenoh::net::runtime: Using ZID: bb3fb16628f57e92f92accf2f5c81511
   zenoh::api::loader: Loading  plugin "remote_api"
   zenoh::api::loader: Starting  plugin "remote_api"
   zenoh::api::loader: Successfully started plugin remote_api from "./target/debug\\zenoh_plugin_remote_api.dll"
   zenoh::api::loader: Finished loading plugins
   zenoh::net::runtime::orchestrator: Zenoh can be reached at: tcp/...
   ```

### Building the library from sources

1. Make sure that the following utilities are available on your platform.

   - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)
   - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
   - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/)
   - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
   - [deno](https://deno.com/) - for command line examples

2. Navigate to the directory `zenoh-ts`

3. Run the commands:

   ```sh
   yarn install 
   yarn build
   ```

   The result are placed into the `zenoh-ts/dist` directory.

   This library is currently compatible with browsers, but not with NodeJS due to websocket library limitations.

### Build and run examples

For simplicity, the examples can be executed from the `zenoh-ts` directory. You may also go directly to the `zenoh-ts/examples`
directory and explore and run examples there.

Make sure that the `zenohd` router with `zenoh-plugin-remote-api` works on localhost and the websocket port is 10000.

To run an example, execute the command `yarn start example_dir [example_name]`

The following examples are available:

- Command line examples
  - Publisher and subscriber

      ```sh
      yarn start deno z_pub
      yarn start deno z_sub
      ```

  - Queryable and get

      ```sh
      yarn start deno z_queryable
      yarn start deno z_get
      ```

      and many more

- Chat in browser example

  ```sh
  yarn start chat
  ```

  The browser window on [localhost:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html) with the chat interface should open. Open another one with the same address, press the "Connect" buttons in both and see how they interact.

### Generating Documentation

1. Make sure that the [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) dependency is installed.

2. Navigate to the directory `zenoh-ts`

3. Run the commands:

```bash
npx typedoc src/index.ts
```
